# Kafka Multi-Agent System

A comprehensive Kafka-based multi-agent system that analyzes GitHub issues, performs research, and generates helpful comments using AI. The system includes a Streamlit UI and can be deployed to OpenShift clusters.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of multiple specialized agents working together through Kafka topics:

- **Issue Reader Agent** - Fetches and analyzes GitHub issues
- **Researcher Agent** - Performs web research on issues
- **Reasoner Agent** - Generates intelligent comment drafts
- **Commenter Agent** - Posts approved comments to GitHub
- **Monitor Agent** - Tracks system performance and metrics
- **UI Consumer** - Provides real-time monitoring interface

## üöÄ Quick Start
